# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
Weekly Challenge 5

## Purpose
Create a calendar application that allows user to save events for each hour of the day, using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

- When the planner is opened, current day, date, and year is displayed at the top.

- The user is presented with time blocks for each hour of the work day, which are color coded for past, present, and future.

- When a time block is clicked, user can enter a new event. After clicking the save button, the event is saved in local storage, and will persist upon page refresh.
